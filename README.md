# OTTO with Arms Code and STL files   v1.0

Arduino Libraries and Sketch, Some basic instructions also included

## Info

Otto has fully functioning arm movements, this has come with a small price to pay, Some of Otto's mouths have been removed
to allow for the additional memory needed for the arms, these include the numbers 5 -9 and the vampire mouths (sorry)
Also only one animated mouth has been left, the sleeping dreamMouth, again the others have been removed for additional memory,
I think the arm movements are worth the sacrifice.

As an open source library, Otto and Myself respect all contributors to the open source community and thank you very much for everyone's supervision.

If you have a question then please post it to the Otto Builder facebook group, this is also a great place for help and advice.
